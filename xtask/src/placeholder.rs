//! The `placeholder` gate.
//!
//! Rejects `todo!`, `unimplemented!`, `#[allow(` and `#[expect(` in the sources of the
//! layout core. The hole it closes is measured rather than theoretical: a function body of
//! `todo!()` draws no diagnostic from rustc or Clippy under this workspace's configuration,
//! so an unwritten answer compiles, formats, lints and ships. Every other gate here asks
//! whether the code says the right thing; this one asks whether it says anything at all.
//!
//! The second half is the first non-negotiable rule in `CONTRIBUTING.md` — no `allow` and no
//! `ignore` — which until now was held by review alone. A suppression is caught wherever the
//! attribute path is written, `cfg_attr` included, because what matters is the silenced
//! finding rather than its spelling.
//!
//! Comments and literals are blanked before the scan, so prose naming a forbidden construct
//! is not one and a string holding `"todo!()"` is data. Blanking keeps the line breaks, so a
//! finding names the line it is written on.
//!
//! See `docs/design/api-spine.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
